  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated to JS, is a <strong>programming language that is one of the <u>core technologies of the World Wide Web</u></strong>, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

  <p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">JavaScript</a> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom:50px">
  The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">JavaScript</a> APIs for I/O.</p>
