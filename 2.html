  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is <strong> a <u>style sheet</u> language</strong> used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
  <p>

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom:50px">
  Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS </a> also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
